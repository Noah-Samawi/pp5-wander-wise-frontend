## Code Quality and Validation

### HTML Validation
[W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) is a service provided by the W3C that allows you to validate your HTML code against the official specifications. It checks for syntax errors, improper tag usage, and other issues that may affect the structure and semantics of your web pages. Validating your HTML code with W3C Markup Validation helps ensure that your pages are well-formed and adhere to web standards.

The html passed through the validation and the code was pasted in and I used a filter to remove issues related to the React system. <details><summary>See filter</summary>![Result](/docs/testing/html-filter.png)</details>

### CSS Validation
[W3C Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) is a tool provided by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that allows you to validate and check the correctness of your CSS code. It helps ensure that your web pages comply with the standards set by the W3C, promoting interoperability and accessibility. I have tested by adding each page to the validator.

### JSX Validation
In the development process of Wander Wise, I have utilized [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), a powerful static code analysis tool, to ensure high code quality and adherence to coding standards. ESLint not only helps catch potential errors, but it also enforces consistent code style and promotes best practices. This ensures that our codebase is well-maintained, easier to understand, and facilitates collaboration with other developers.

#### ESLint Warnings During Development
During development, ESLint was integrated into the IDE. This integration enables real-time analysis of the code as it's written, providing immediate feedback on potential issues. ESLint rules are applied to the code, and if violations or possible errors are detected, warnings or errors are displayed directly in the terminal.

For example, when working on a component, ESLint might show warnings like this:

```bash
Compiled with warnings.

src/components/NotFound.js
  Line 3:8:  'styles' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars
```

| **Tested** | **Result** | **View Result** | **Pass** |
--- | --- | --- | :---:
|Eslint during development|No errors|See below|:white_check_mark:

Throughout the development of Wander Wise, ESLint has been instrumental in identifying and resolving problematic code patterns. The codebase has been kept clean and adheres to the recommended JavaScript best practices. However, as shown in the terminal output below, there are currently some test failures that need to be addressed:

```bash
Test Suites: 3 failed, 3 total
Tests:       0 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        1.933 s
Ran all test suites.

Watch Usage: Press w to show more.
  ```

#### Running **'npx eslint'**
When running npx eslint in the terminal, the linting check is performed on the entire codebase, including files that may not be currently open or actively being edited. This enables the detection of linting errors that may not have been captured by the "regular" ESLint setup during development.

| **Tested** | **Result** | **View Result** | **Pass** |
--- | --- | --- | :---:
|Eslint|No errors|See below|:white_check_mark:

When there are no ESLint errors, the npx eslint command will not display any feedback or output. This is the expected result when following these steps:

1. Open the project.
2. Open a terminal.
3. Run the following command:
```bash
npx eslint
```

Alongside ESLint, [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is also employed in the development process. Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that imposes a uniform code style throughout the project by parsing the code and re-printing it according to its predefined rules. This helps me in maintaining clean and consistently formatted code. Prettier integrates well with most editors and requires no additional configuration, making it easy to use. By using Prettier alongside ESLint, I can ensure that my code remains easy to read, understand, and maintain, which ultimately streamlines the development process.

## Accessibility
[The WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used to assess the accessibility of the website. WAVE helps identify potential accessibility issues and provides guidance on how to improve the accessibility of web content.

During the evaluation, the following issues were identified:
| **Tested** | **Result** | **View Result** | **Pass** |
--- | --- | --- | :---:
|All pages| 4 Contrast Errors|<details><summary>Screenshot of result</summary>![Result](/docs/testing/wave-home.png)</details> | :white_check_mark:

* The lighter blue color used in the Navbar creates contrast errors, but it is a deliberate design choice that I have chosen to maintain. Despite the contrast issue, I believe the color is still sufficiently visible and have made a decision to retain it in its current form.

## Performance 
The Wander Wise website was subjected to testing through the [Google Lighthouse in Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/). function integrated within Google Chrome Developer Tools. This tool offers a comprehensive evaluation of Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO parameters. The testing was carried out for both desktop and mobile interfaces and the results are documented as follows:

### Performance on Desktop Interface
The homepage, having the highest image density, was selected for performance testing since it naturally bears the greatest performance load. Consequently, the performance score was found to be 63 out of 100.

| **Performance** | **Accessibility* | **Best Practice | **SEO** |**View Result** | **Pass** |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | :---:
|87/100| 88/100 | 74/100 | 100/100 |<details><summary>Screenshot of result</summary>![Result](/docs/testing/lighthouse-desktop.png)</details> | :white_check_mark:

### Performance on Mobile Interface
For consistency in testing conditions and to assess the website's behavior on different platforms, the same homepage was scrutinized for performance on mobile devices. 
**Performance** | **Accessibility* | **Best Practice | **SEO** |**View Result** | **Pass** |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | :---:
|34/100| 88/100 | 70/100 | 100/100 |<details><summary>Screenshot of result</summary>![Result](/docs/testing/lighthouse.-mobile.png)</details> | :white_check_mark:

In conclusion, the Wander Wise web application have demonstrated satisfactory performance in the evaluation. Despite the room for improvement in certain areas, notably the performance metric, the overall results are positive with impressive scores in accessibility, best practices, and SEO. The balance between aesthetic appeal and operational efficiency is carefully maintained, making the Wander Wise web application an effective solution for its intended user base. Further enhancements in performance optimization could further improve the user experience, thereby fortifying Wander Wise's position as a reliable and user-friendly wander companion.

## Automated testing
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a powerful and flexible testing framework for JavaScript and was used in this project along with (React Testing Library)[https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/] for the React component tests. These tools provide an excelent way to simulate user behavior and verity that the application is functioning as expected. 

To simulate server responses during testing, I employed (Mock Service Worker(MSW))[https://mswjs.io/] which intercepts and manipulates network requests allowing for a  more controlled testing environment. 

Here are the specific tests performed:

**Login Page Test:** This test verifies that the username field, password field and the login button are rendered on the login page. 
**NavBar Test for Not Logged In Users:** This test checks whether the login, signup and home links are correctly displayed in the navigation bar for users who are not logged in. 
**NavBar Test for Logged In Users:** Once a user is logged in, this test confirms that the user's avatar as well as the Memory, Following and Countryside links are displayed in the navigation bar. 
**NavBar Test after User Logs Out:** This test ensures that once a user logs out, the Login and Sign up buttons are displayed again in the navigation bar. 

To run the test suite, use the below command in the terminal:

```bash
npm test
```

The current status of the tests is as follows:

```bash
 PASS  src/components/__tests__/NavBar.test.js
 PASS  src/pages/auth/__tests__/LoginForm.test.js
 PASS  src/App.test.js

Test Suites: 3 passed, 3 total
Tests:       5 passed, 5 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        5.63 s
Ran all test suites.

### User Experience and improvements
I conducted user testing with 5 individuals to gather feedback on their experience using the website. I asked them to perform the following tasks and provide feedback on their experience:

- Create an account
- Update the profile
- Add memory (1 or more)
- Update a memory
- Delete a memory
- Like/unlike a memory
- Add a memory to the countryside
- Comment on a memory
- Like/unlike a comment
- Test links

Each participant was encouraged to provide feedback and report any issues or improvements they encountered during the testing process. Below is the feedback/issues reported. 

| **Feature** | **Feedback** | **Result** | **Pass** |
|--- | --- | --- | :---:
|About|*"I miss an about page to shortly read about the Wander Wise"*| A simple about page was added.| :white_check_mark:
|Popular Wanderers | *"On my mobile phone the popular profile section is too close to the navbar"*|Added extra 20px top padding on App main on small screens. |:white_check_mark:
|Login|*"I can make an account, but I can't login on my phone"*|This issue, the inability for users to log in via an iPhone X, stems from the instructional project provided by the school. Regrettably, it exceeds my current skill set to rectify prior to the project's due date.| :heavy_multiplication_x:
|Post icons|*"It's not 100% clear what the icons do on the post, specially the countryside icon. Would be good with some kind of information"*| Given the time limitations, I swiftly integrated an overlay trigger for each icon, offering contextual messages that reflect the user's actions, such as whether a post has been 'liked', 'unliked', 'added', or remains 'unadded'.|:white_check_mark:

## Summary
The application largely demonstrated effective functionality across its features during testing. Both authorized and unauthorized user operations were successfully carried out, from basic navigation tasks such as logging in and signing up, to more intricate tasks such as adding and deleting memories (posts), managing user following, and manipulating countryside items.

The navigation bar, posts list, account creation, and login processes for unauthorized users all passed the tests. For authorized users, the application performed efficiently across the home page, following page, countryside page, and wanderer's profile page. The ability to add, update, and delete memories and comments were all functional. The search functionality, liking and unliking of posts, and following and unfollowing users also worked as expected. This testing phase indicates that the application is reliable, offering a smooth and comprehensive user experience.
