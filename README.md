### Component Architecture and Reusability
Wander Wise is a social web application that empowers users to share wander experiences, explore new destinations, and interact with other wander enthusiasts. The app's architecture comprises several reusable components that streamline development and ensure a consistent user experience.

#### Core Components
- **Asset:** This component handles the display of a spinner or an image, along with an optional message. It's used across various parts of the application, such as NotFound, PostCreateForm, PostPage, PostsPage, PopularWanderers, and WandererPage, to provide visual feedback during data loading or to display specific images for information. 
- **Avatar:** This component displays user profile images. It's reused in the NavBar, Posts, Comments, and Wanderer sections to maintain consistency and personalization across the application.
- **MoreDropdown:** A general-purpose dropdown menu component reused in Comment, Post, and the Wanderer's profile page for various context-based actions.
- **NavBar:** A navigation bar component shown on all pages to ensure seamless navigation across the app.
- **NotFound:** A component shown when a requested resource is not found or a certain result does not exist.

#### Component Pages

The use of the React library in the Wander Wise project has significantly contributed to enhancing the user experience. React's component-based architecture has helped create reusable components such as Asset, Avatar, MoreDropdown, NavBar, and others. These components not only ensure consistent look and feel across the application but also make the codebase more maintainable and easier to update or extend.

One particular feature where React has been instrumental is the implementation of infinite scrolling using the react-infinite-scroll-component. This feature greatly enhances user experience by loading data incrementally as the user scrolls, providing a seamless browsing experience without traditional pagination interruptions. Coupled with the axios library for asynchronous data fetching, the application is able to provide users with a non-blocking, smooth, and enjoyable browsing experience. The use of the react-router-dom also enhances navigation experience, allowing us to create a single-page application with multiple views that load instantly, providing a near-native user experience.

### Surface

#### Design Choices
The design of Wander Wise embraces a minimalistic yet warm aesthetic, capturing the joy and tranquility we often experience during our wanders. The design aimed to mirror the exciting, yet peaceful experiences of exploration and global discovery. This balance was achieved by using clean lines, easy-to-read typography, and a color palette inspired by the nature's diverse landscapes.

#### Colour

![Mockup image](/docs/colors.png)
The color palette was carefully chosen to represent nature and its multitude of wonders. Columbia blue symbolizes the expanse of the sky, bringing a sense of calm and tranquility to the design. White represents purity and simplicity, providing a clean and refreshing counterpoint to the other colors. Buff, a warm beige tone, symbolizes the earth and ground beneath us, offering warmth and stability. French gray and platinum capture the subtle beauty of natural elements, adding a touch of elegance and sophistication. This comprehensive color palette harmoniously encapsulates the beauty of our planet, inviting users into a visually appealing and relatable space.

#### Typography
The typography chosen for Wander Wise is both Lato and Roboto, selected for their readability and clean aesthetics. Lato, a sans-serif typeface, offers a warm yet professional tone, while still embodying an unassuming simplicity. It's highly legible at small sizes, making it ideal for body text. In contrast, Roboto, with its wide letterforms and clean lines, is used for headers and subheaders to grab user attention while maintaining readability. The combination of these fonts provides an engaging user experience, with typography that's accessible and friendly, yet polished and professional.

## Methodology
The Wander Wise project has been developed using agile principles, enabling efficient collaboration, iterative development, and effective project management. The following methodology has been employed throughout the project:

### Agile Project Management with GitHub Projects
GitHub Projects has been utilized to facilitate agile project management. User stories and bugs have been organized as GitHub issues, allowing for a clear and structured approach to development. The project board in GitHub Projects serves as a Kanban board, providing an overview of the project's progress.

### User Stories as GitHub Issues
Each user story has been created as a GitHub issue, capturing the desired functionality from the user's perspective. The user stories are linked to their corresponding GitHub issues, allowing easy access to the acceptance criteria, tasks, and comments associated with each user story.

### Commit and Issue Linking
In the spirit of maintaining transparency and traceability in the project's development, commits associated with a user story or a bug have been linked directly to the corresponding GitHub issue. This feature of GitHub helps in providing a complete picture of the changes made to address each user story or fix each bug.

### Bug Tracking
Bugs encountered during the development process have also been logged as GitHub issues. These issues contain details about the specific bug, its impact, and steps to reproduce it. By linking the bugs in the README.md to their respective GitHub issues and commits, it's possible to gain insights into the bugs' resolution progress and view any additional comments.

### Iterative Development Approach
The Wander Wise project follows an iterative development approach, allowing for continuous improvement and progress while adhering to time constraints. The development process is structured into sprints, with each sprint typically lasting around 6 days.

To ensure efficient prioritization, the project employs the MuSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) method. User stories critical to the app's success are categorized as Must-haves, followed by Should-haves, Could-haves, and Won't-haves. You can refer to the [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/Noah-Samawi/projects/13) to view the prioritization.

Within each sprint, a MoSCoW method is used to further prioritize user stories. They are classified as Must Do, Should Do, Could Do, and Won't Do, representing the remaining user stories that will not be included in the sprints. This approach ensures a clear differentiation between the overall project prioritization and the prioritization within each sprint, minimizing any potential confusion.

**Sprint 4 recap:** 
The focus was on finalizing the project and completing essential user stories. The About page, the ability to like comments, and the implementation of the location feature were successfully accomplished. Documentation, including the creation of a 404-page, and improving application deployment were also completed. While some user stories were moved to the backlog for future consideration, the application was thoroughly tested to ensure its functionality and quality.

### Backlog and Subsequent Iterations 
The user stories are tracked on the project board, and the "To do" column represents the backlog of user stories (also see above), indicating the tasks that will be addressed in subsequent iterations.

Please note that even though the project timeline has been accelerated, the iterative development approach allows for ongoing improvements and enhancements to meet the evolving needs of users.

For a comprehensive view of the project progress, user stories, and bug tracking, please see the [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/Noah-Samawi/projects/13).
